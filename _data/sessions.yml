With that in mind, how do we have meaningful conversations about data equity, social justice and data justice?"

It has been said that all reporters will become climate reporters, and this session seeks to explore that possibility and what it means in practice. Life-threatening emergencies are when communities most need reliable information, and also when the most marginalized are at the center of the impact. Whether it's a wildfire or a winter storm, the biggest challenges are often about getting reliable info to those who need it most, and these challenges are best faced by activating existing community connections.\n\nThis session seeks to examine what frameworks, resources, and tools we can share in order to prepare for the unexpected, bringing together the lived experiences of participants with case studies and examples of local reporting before, during, and after such events. This session will explore how the act of sharing information and journalism can be a form of mutual aid, building trust and creating change, especially as climate change is bringing a new scale of disasters into our everyday lives. Participants will leave with a shared resource they can use during their own work."

So does the industry actually communicate in a way that encourages those behavior changes? \n\nOften the answer is no, as we continually return to language that deepens conflict or (unintentionally) encourages disengagement. Thankfully, there are examples of healthier, holistic communication techniques within journalism and in surprising fields outside of it that can contribute to bringing communities together and getting problems solved. In an interactive session, we'll share research from journalism, neuroscience, community psychology, narrative, and more. Journalists will unlock new ways of interviewing, reporting, and talking about stories that contribute to feelings of agency and connectedness rather than defeating them."

Election forecasting efforts are often misunderstood by readers. And we know the conversation doesn’t stop after a checkmark appears saying the race has been called. For this session, let’s break out of institutional constraints and reimagine how we could run election results with readers, while understanding what they get out of live results.\n\nWe will discuss challenges to designing real-time data visualizations, which can create feelings of uncertainty for what is ultimately a knowable outcome. We will brainstorm better priorities for election results reporting and explore designs that emphasize those new priorities. Ultimately, we hope participants leave inspired and encouraged to lean into the special context they can bring to coverage on our democratic processes, even if that means letting go of something that’s always been done."

This means it does not get prioritized and is less likely to happen. So, how can we make that easier? How can technology and/or news products help with that?\n\nAt Trusting News we have seen several newsrooms use their CMS to build in tools that make adding transparency elements and/or engagement opportunities easier for journalists to do in their daily reporting. We have also learned that when it's in the CMS and easy for journalists to implement, they are more likely to do it. The more this happens, the more opportunity there is for people to be exposed to this type of journalism, which can hopefully improve trust in news overall.

We will create a working document and checklist to transform essential service journalism into an engine of social, political and community change through community collaboration and empowerment. Not only understanding how things impact a community but how those systems can be impacted by community actions with an eye towards upcoming election cycles to break the horse race mentality. We will use a playbook developed by RJI & The Green Line as a starting point as session participants bring their experience and perspectives to create this resource."

As time has worn on and we move to more hybrid models of work, it’s important to consider how the standard processes and tools we’ve always relied on have worked (and not worked) for us. This interactive session will deconstruct these models and identify ways we can improve how we work together that is both productive and inclusive for all.\n\nQuestions this session might answer:\n\n* For people that are in the office, what processes and tools can you put in place to ensure you include remote colleagues?\n* For remote employees, what can you do to proactively to connect with people working in the office?\n* As an organization, how might we look at inclusion across the employee experience in a hybrid workplace?"

    "description": "From the mobile revolution to the pandemic, the past two decades have handed us change after change after change. And more is coming. The rise of artificial intelligence signals the beginning of a novel kind of disruption.\n\nMuch of this change is good for the journalism profession. At the same time, too much change, too fast, is counter-productive. We become spread thin and don't have the time or energy needed to learn new things. Even worse, we risk burnout.\n\nHow can we continue to adapt journalism to meet the moment while ensuring the humans doing the work can keep up?\n\nIn this session, we'll break into small groups to discuss the challenges that come with constant newsroom change and strategies for balancing innovation with the workload of journalists. Then we'll regroup, share notes and build a guide you can bring back to your newsroom."

    "description": "Mental models are foundational to how people understand the world. When complex systems aren't clear, often it's because individual parts of the system aren't well-defined, or their relation to each other is unclear or inconsistent. Object-oriented UX ([big hat-tip to Sophia Prater](https://www.ooux.com/people/sophiavprater)) addresses this with an analytical approach to breaking down complexity. \n\nDuring this session, we'll look at how thinking in objects can help you assemble tools and stories that make sense to other people (and you!). While the OOUX discipline is grounded in object-oriented UI design, the principles can also help you map out things beyond digital products—think complex org structures, sprawling social systems, and physical environments. The framework will help you visualize key relationships so you can better understand and explain how they work.\n\nYou can bring your own project to the session or work with examples we'll have. You don't have to have UX design experience to get something out of this session! The primary goal is giving you another way to tackle complexity."

    "facilitators": "Aparna Komarla",
    "description": "Without high-quality COVID-19 data, it is impossible to improve public health decision-making and outcomes. These limitations disproportionately affect vulnerable and marginalized groups such as incarcerated populations. In California, the most populous state in the United States, local jails that incarcerate over 80,000 people pending trial or sentencing on any given day have notoriously fallen through the cracks regarding COVID-19 data transparency. No state authority has established a technologically advanced and centralized effort to capture this critical data. \n\nThe [Covid In-Custody Project](https://covidincustody.org/) is a data journalism initiative that leverages freedom of information laws and technology such as image recognition, web scraping and analytics to aggregate data on infection and vaccination rates in hundreds of public records retrieved from law enforcement agencies. We uncovered over 60,000 positive cases and several deaths that were previously kept under wraps. Our data is integrated in the United States’ Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) COVID-19 tracker for correctional facilities via a partnership with the University of California Los Angeles School of Law. The reluctance from law enforcement agencies to disclose public records and their backwardness in data documentation is a curious case of unbridled authority these institutions exercise. \n\nThrough our data collection and journalism, we show that the COVID-19 pandemic in California jails is a perfect example of the value and opportunity to bring technology, law and policy together in the public sector at a national, state and local level, and the consequences of not doing so."

    "description": "Twitter used to be an important place for journalists. However, since Elon Musk bought the place in late 2022, things have changed. Cuts to the trust & safety team have left many users feeling unsafe on the platform. Journalists have been banned for work Musk personally doesn't like, and press inquiries are automatically replied to with a poop emoji. Some observers have even hypothesized that Elon Musk may be trying to create a next-generation Fox News.\n\nHow should journalists, both individually and as organizations, proceed? Does our participation in Twitter implicate us in Musk's political maneuvering? Is simply leaving the service an act of privilege, disregarding the circumstances of people who, whatever Twitter' issues, have no better place to be in community? Which of the emerging alternatives have promise?\n\nIn this session, we'll discuss these challenges, but mostly in service of developing a constructive near-future vision: What do we as journalists and as human beings want and need from social media? And what can we do to make it better for all of us?"

    "facilitators": "Meg Martin, Yoohyun Jung",
    "description": "Let’s face it: We’re not an industry that’s particularly revered for the way we prepare people to take on more responsibility within our organizations. Pathways to new opportunities—whether next-step management roles or peer-leadership opportunities—are often dim, if they exist at all. We’re not great at preparing people to be editors. And we often promote people into leadership roles because they were good at something entirely else. (You’re a superstar developer? Come run the team! A top-notch reporter? Why not become an editor?) The systems within news organizations aren’t often set up to support their middle managers and others who step up into leadership roles, whether on short-term projects or in long-term jobs.\n\nBut those are often exactly the people in the room with the most impact on their colleagues, and on people’s experience of the organization and of their work. They have the most direct impact on people’s day-to-day work lives—an incredible responsibility!—and play a crucial role in the culture, wellbeing and happiness of their organization.\n\nSo: What to do, if your work involves leading teams, leading a project, coordinating colleagues? Particularly if you feel as though you’re working in a vacuum, or could use a little support that seems a bit out of reach? It can help to have a map, and if your newsroom isn’t equipped to help you build it, let’s start that work together in this workshop.\n\nWe’d like for you to walk away with a blueprint to help you start thinking through ways to fill in the gaps in training, support and focus that will help you better serve your team, your project and your community. Together, we’ll:\n* Focus in on the contribution we want to be for our teams, our newsrooms and our community; craft the story of our work\n* Identify our personal training and support needs\n* Plot out a plan to build our peer network and informal advisory board\n* Design the beginnings of a training and learning plan\n* Find ways to regularly incorporate protected time in our schedule for reflection, development, mentoring and peer support"
