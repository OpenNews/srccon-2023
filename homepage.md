### When & where

On October 17-18 in Minneapolis, SRCCON returns to the [McNamara Alumni Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/McNamara+Alumni+Center/@44.975199,-93.2301774,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52b32d18ed516031:0x5f984f594ceab6ad!8m2!3d44.975199!4d-93.2279887).

Our program will begin around 9am on Tuesday and close by 6pm Wednesday. If you’re figuring out travel plans, most participants arrive Monday afternoon and leave Thursday morning.

We have reserved a block of rooms at the [Graduate Minneapolis Hotel](https://www.graduatehotels.com/minneapolis/) at a base rate of $139 per night. We will have a link to reserve a room to share soon. The Graduate Hotel is located directly next to the SRCCON venue and is connected by a tunnel in case of bad weather.

We're excited to be back in Minneapolis! SRCCON 2023 will be in-person only. There will not be a hybrid or virtual version of this event. We will continue to offer virtual programming throughout the year, such as our [bi-weekly community calls](https://opennews.org/what/community/calls), and expect that several sessions will be documented publicly on our site Source.

#### COVID safety guidelines

At SRCCON, we prioritize caring for each other. One way we'll do that this year is by masking throughout the conference while indoors and not actively eating, drinking, or facilitating. We're excited to be back at our longtime SRCCON venue, but it's a spot without windows that open or outdoor session spaces. Given that our options for improved air flow are limited, we've decided to use a tool we've all gotten very familiar with: masks!

We will be modeling our COVID safety policies largely off of the [PyCon 2023 policies](https://us.pycon.org/2023/about/health-safety-guidelines), which means we will be requiring masking while indoors throughout the conference. We'll have ample masks available, and encourage participants to bring their preferred N95, KN95, or similar masks as well. Exceptions to masking indoors include while consuming food, for speakers when presenting, and when necessary to communicate with someone who is hearing impaired. 

We also strongly encourage all participants to be up to date on their vaccinations. We will further update this policy as we get closer to the event. If you have any questions or need further information now, please [reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

### What you can expect

The SRCCON program is focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. At SRCCON, you’ll:

* Be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine newsroom tech, teamwork, leadership, community, and journalism itself—not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn.
* Connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism—not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* Bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule—even games & meals—as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

SRCCON events are highly participatory, where participants come first so they can can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. The conversations that happen here come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We lead change**—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for long-lasting change in our organizations, led by journalists of color and journalists in local and regional newsrooms.
* **We support one another**—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We experiment in the open**—by sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.
