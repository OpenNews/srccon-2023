### Help us build this year's program

# Our call for participation is open!

**[We’re accepting session proposals through Wednesday, June 14](/participation/form).** Thinking about an idea for SRCCON 2023? Take a look at [our proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/), then [tell us all about it](/participation/form)!

SRCCON sessions are workshops, not panels. Conversations, not presentations. This is a hands-on event about changing journalism—we're looking for [topics you don't see at traditional conferences](/sessions/proposal-guide/#what-we-look-for), and sessions that help people imagine a better future together. Our whole program (including breaks and meals!) is about discussion and connection as peers. If you haven't led a session like that before, our [proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/) is here to help (and [so are we](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)).

Our [call for participation form](/participation/form/) includes questions to tell us about all the ways you might want to participate at SRCCON, including as an attendee or a session facilitator. We will review entries and notify everyone by June 28. If invited to attend or facilitate a session, you will receive a link to purchase a ticket with [prices starting at $250 plus fees](/attendees/#tickets).

## Key dates for your calendar

* **May 31**: call for participation opens
* **June 14**: call for participation for sessions and scholarships closes
* **June 28**: last day by which participants will be notified
* **After June 28**: we'll review more participation forms for attendees only, on a rolling basis until the conference
* **October 17-18**: SRCCON takes place in Minneapolis, MN

Curious about how it all works? Learn more about [being a participant at SRCCON](/attendees) and [our call for participation form](/participation/form). There won't be a separate ticket lottery or sale date, so if you want to come to SRCCON 2023, our call for participation is how to let us know! As space remains available, we will keep the call for participation open for tickets after the June 14 deadline, but applying by that date is your best chance to attend.

### When & where

On October 17-18 in Minneapolis, SRCCON returns to the [McNamara Alumni Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/McNamara+Alumni+Center/@44.975199,-93.2301774,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52b32d18ed516031:0x5f984f594ceab6ad!8m2!3d44.975199!4d-93.2279887).

Once tickets are sold, we'll be opening up a discounted block of rooms for participants at a nearby hotel.

We're excited to be back in Minneapolis! SRCCON 2023 will be in-person only. There will not be a hybrid or virtual version of this event. We will continue to offer virtual programming throughout the year, such as our [bi-weekly community calls](https://opennews.org/what/community/calls), and expect that several sessions will be documented publicly on our site Source.

We are still developing our COVID safety policy for this event. It will be published when ticket sales open. We're gathering examples from other conferences such as [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2023/about/health-safety-guidelines/) and [ONA](https://ona23.journalists.org/faq/#1648654048660-8ffe33ac-5321), and considering the specific needs and values of the OpenNews community as well. If you have any input, concerns, or needs, [reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

### What you can expect

The SRCCON program is focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. At SRCCON, you’ll:

* Be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine newsroom tech, teamwork, leadership, community, and journalism itself—not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn.
* Connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism—not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* Bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule—even games & meals—as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

SRCCON events are highly participatory, where participants come first so they can can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. The conversations that happen here come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We lead change**—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for long-lasting change in our organizations, led by journalists of color and journalists in local and regional newsrooms.
* **We support one another**—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We experiment in the open**—by sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.
